## Software maturity and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)

Technology Readiness Level
Expected Properties

### TRL 1 - Project Initiation

- Project owner identified
- Project principles and high-level objectives defined
- Use case definitions (includes target users and activities)

### TRL 2 - Conceptualization

- Analytic study of the problem space
- Identify key functions which must be validated in Component Implementation
- Formulate validation criteria for critical components
- Formulate validation criteria of complete prototype system
- Prototype Epic planning

### TRL 3 - PoC Implementation

- Implementations of key functions
- Validation of critical concepts
- Identification of additional validation criteria for TRL4

### TRL 4 - Prototype Component

- Validation of prototype components in Lab
- PoC has become prototype components
- System technology selection has been made
- Load testing of components under key load criteria
- Identification of additional validation criteria for TRL5

### TRL 5 - Prototype Integration

- Validation of integrated system in a real-world environment
- Tested in restricted environment with a small number of real users
- Data formats specified
- Identification of additional validation criteria for TRL6

### TRL 6 - Prototype-to-Real-world Integration

- Validation of integrated system in a real-world environment
- Load testing of integrated system under expected load
- Tested in a real-world environment with a small number of real users
- Initial System documentation
- Initial User documentation
- System monitoring points specified (for services)
- Identification of additional validation criteria for TRL7

### TRL 7 - Operational Integration

- Validation of integrated system in a real-world environment
- Tested in a real-world environment with a small number of real users (canary testing for SoA)
- System monitoring implemented (for services)
- No expected data format or API changes (for services or software components)
- Load testing of integrated system under expected load
- SLA monitored (for services)

### TRL 8 - Deployment

- Validation of integrated system in a real-world environment
- Tested in a real-world environment with a small number of real users
- SLA enforced (for services)

### TRL 9 - Production

- Validation of integrated system in a real-world environment
- Tested in a real-world environment with a target number of real users
