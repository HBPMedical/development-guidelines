# Effective Docker

* use Docker to run your apps, which apps are available from Docker; navigate Docker hub, quay.io, SP8 catalog of Docker images - suggest inclusion of Docker references to PLA
* docker-compose to test complex applications with ease
* TRL5: build, release cycle; deploy a new release to Docker hub
* TRL9: continuous deployment with now.sh and web hooks
* graph of Docker images, to use to reduce footprint and upgrade all base images following security updates
