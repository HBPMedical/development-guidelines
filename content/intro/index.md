## Development guidelines for the Medical Informatics Platform

Those guidelines should serve as guidance for all contributors of the HBP Medical Informatics Platform,
from core platform developers, service developers as well as developers and scientists providing
new algorithms, data pipelines or visualisation components.

The European Commission uses the concept of [Technical Readiness Level](../maturity/trls) to evaluate the
quality and fitness of our contributions. One core idea of this guide is to provide concrete actions and
checks to help each component to progress towards the highest level of maturity.

Those actions should be easy to follow as they are based on the best practices from software industry,
and for the most part require no investment in infrastructure and tools as we can use
free tooling and cloud services available for open-source developers.
